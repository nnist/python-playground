- read https://www.renditioninfosec.com/2017/09/password-length-or-complexity-math-says-length/
- read https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/374/how-should-i-calculate-the-entropy-of-a-password#376
- find out how to calculate entropy

uh. limiting yourself to only easily typeable characters might have some
security risks.
how much better is it than a regular password?
'qwertiopasdfgjkl' are the only chars. it's 16 chars. attackers will know
most chars are like this. (only if they know though... how likely is that?)

- Add short useful info about passphrases, with sources
- Checkboxes for verbs, nouns, etc.
- Add selector for only or no verbs/nouns
- Add dictionaries for verbs and nouns
- Add reset button to form
- English and Dutch languages
- Dockerize
